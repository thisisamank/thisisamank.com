# Promotions Are Proactive, Not Reactive

If you're waiting for your manager to notice your good work and promote you, you're playing the wrong game. Here's how to take control of your career trajectory.

## The Promotion Myth

Many engineers believe that:
- Good work automatically leads to promotions
- Managers actively look for people to promote
- Technical excellence is all that matters

**Reality**: Promotions require strategic career management.

## How to Get Promoted

### 1. Understand the Criteria
- What skills are needed for the next level?
- What impact is expected?
- How is success measured?

### 2. Make Your Work Visible
- Document your achievements
- Share wins with your manager
- Present at team meetings
- Write about your projects

### 3. Seek Feedback Early
- Don't wait for performance reviews
- Ask for specific areas to improve
- Create a development plan

### 4. Build Your Network
- Work with other teams
- Mentor junior developers
- Contribute to company initiatives

### 5. Take on Promotion-Level Work
- Volunteer for high-visibility projects
- Lead initiatives
- Solve problems above your current level

## The Conversation

Have explicit conversations about your career goals:
- "I'm interested in being promoted to Senior Engineer"
- "What do I need to demonstrate to get there?"
- "Can we create a timeline and checkpoints?"

Your career is your responsibility. Be proactive about it.
