# Understanding Microservices

Breaking down monolithic applications into microservices: benefits, challenges, and when to make the transition.

## When to Consider Microservices

- Your team has grown beyond 8-10 people
- Different parts of your system have different scaling requirements
- You want to use different technologies for different services
- You need independent deployment cycles

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Scale individual services based on demand
- **Technology diversity**: Use the right tool for each job
- **Team autonomy**: Teams can work independently
- **Fault isolation**: Failures are contained to individual services

## Challenges

- **Distributed system complexity**: Network calls, latency, failures
- **Data consistency**: Managing transactions across services
- **Testing complexity**: Integration testing becomes harder
- **Operational overhead**: More services to deploy and monitor

The key is to start with a monolith and split when you have clear business and technical reasons to do so.
