# Don't Fall for the XY Problem, Ask the Right Questions

The XY problem is a common communication issue that leads to wasted time and frustration in engineering teams. Learn how to identify it and ask better questions.

## What is the XY Problem?

The XY problem occurs when someone:
1. Wants to do X
2. Doesn't know how to do X
3. Thinks of a solution Y
4. Asks how to do Y instead of X

## Example

**Bad approach:**
"How do I extract the last 3 characters from a filename?"

**Better approach:**
"How do I get the file extension from a filename?"

The first question assumes a specific solution (substring extraction), while the second reveals the actual goal (getting the extension).

## How to Avoid It

- **State your actual goal first**: What are you trying to accomplish?
- **Provide context**: Why do you need this?
- **Don't assume your approach is correct**: Be open to alternative solutions
- **Ask "What are you really trying to do?"** when helping others

Good communication starts with understanding the real problem, not jumping to solutions.
